Since project start in 2011, I have been a team member of the [Human Behavior Monitoring and Support (HBMS)](https://ae-ainf.aau.at/hbms/) project, where we have developed an assistive system for human behavior support (Founder: Klaus Tschira Stiftung, Heidelberg). See the video playlist for some insights and results. Further information can be found in my publication list.
