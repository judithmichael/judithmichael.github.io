The semantic difference from one model to another model contains the elements in the semantics of the former model 
that are no elements in the semantics of the latter model. Revealing the semantic differences from one model 
version to a successor model version facilitates to understand the semantic impact of the syntactic changes 
that have been applied to the original model version to obtain the successor model version. In this project, 
we have developed semantic differencing methods for various concrete modeling languages and concrete modeling 
language-independent methods that facilitate solving semantic model evolution analysis problems.
