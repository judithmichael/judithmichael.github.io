The Internet – in its meaning of a worldwide socio-technical network – has revolutionized accessibility of data and 
knowledge. This idea has been transferred to the physical world with the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT). 
A direct application of the IoT approach to production is currently not sufficiently feasible. 
There are many more parameters but much less available data than other big data application domains. 
Vast amounts of data characterize modern production. However, this data is neither easily accessible, interpretable, 
nor connected to gain knowledge. With the [Internet of Production (IoP)](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/bktz), 
we have the vision to enable a new level of cross-domain collaboration by providing semantically adequate and 
context-aware data from production, development, and usage in real-time on an appropriate level of granularity.
The central scientific approach is the introduction of Digital Twins and Digital Shadows. 
The Cluster of Excellence designs and implements a conceptual reference infrastructure for the 
Internet of Production that enables the generation and application of Digital Shadows. 
The vision of IoP is to enable a new level of cross-domain collaboration by providing semantically 
adequate and context-aware data from production, development, and usage in real-time, 
on an adequate level of granularity.
