### Model-Based DevOps (MBDO)


The goal in the MBDO project is to provide the foundations for a Model-Based DevOps framework unifying 
different forms of models in the specific context of cloud-native and IoT systems. 
The proposed Model-Based DevOps framework would then allow engineers to smoothly go back and forth from 
Dev time to Ops time by leveraging semi-automatically generated digital twins of their systems.


MBDO is jointly realized by RWTH Aachen University, Stuttgart University, and
Université de Rennes 1 and funded by the ANR and DFG.
