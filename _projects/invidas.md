### Interaktive, visuelle Datenräume zur souveränen, datenschutzrechtlichen Entscheidungsfindung (InviDas)


Many people are increasingly surrounded by digital technologies and applications that collect, 
process and share personal data. At the same time, few read and understand the often long and complicated 
privacy statements of their individual devices and applications. 
Within the InviDas project, we ensure that users of smart wearables, such as fitness watches, 
will in future have better insight into their data profiles and will thus be able to make 
informed decisions more easily. 
New forms of data visualization and gamification are being researched, with which both manufacturers and users can 
make data privacy declarations more comprehensible and transparent.


The InviDas project is jointly realized by the Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V., Stiftung Digitale Chancen, 
Garmin Würzburg GmbH, RWTH Aachen University (Software Engineering, Chair and Institute of Industrial Engineering 
and Ergonomics and Applied Ethics), Universität Bremen and Otto-Friedrich Universität Bamberg.
The project is funded by the BMBF. For more information have a look at the [project website](https://invidas.gi.de/)
