About Me
I am a PostDoc and team leader for Model-Based Assistance and Information Services at the chair of [Software Engineering](https://www.se-rwth.de/) of Prof. Bernhard Rumpe at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/). Since 2016, I am a member of the supervisory board of the [Lakeside Science & Technology Park GmbH](https://www.lakeside-scitec.com/), Austria. 
Before, I was a member of the Application Engineering Research Group of Prof. Heinrich C. Mayr at the Faculty of Technical Sciences at [Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt](https://www.aau.at/) and a member of the supervisory board of the Carinthian Tech Research AG (CTR, Austria), a research center for intelligent sensors. From 2006 on, I have worked in internships, as a project staff member, software engineer, and consultant in Austrian IT-companies.

My research focus is (conceptual) models in a variety of domains and applications, domain-specific modeling languages and methods, model-based software engineering and software architectures. Recent work deals with privacy-preserving system design, the human factor on the internet of production, smart assisted living, the semantic analysis of models, behavior goal modeling and assistive and informative systems in general.

Moreover, I am a member of the extended Board of Management of the German Informatics Society e.V. (GI). In 2015, I have been appointed as a Junior Fellow of the GI.
