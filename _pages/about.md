## About Me

I am a PostDoc and team leader at the chair of 
[Software Engineering](https://www.se-rwth.de/) of Prof. Bernhard Rumpe at 
[RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/), 
a member of the supervisory board of the 
[Lakeside Science & Technology Park GmbH](https://www.lakeside-scitec.com/), Austria (since 2016),
and a member of the [Executive Committee (Präsidium)](https://gi.de/ueber-uns/leitung/praesidium) 
of the [German Informatics Society e.V. (GI)](https://gi.de). 
Before, I was a member of the Application Engineering Research Group of Prof. Heinrich C. Mayr 
at the Faculty of Technical Sciences at [Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt](https://www.aau.at/) and 
a member of the supervisory board of the Carinthian Tech Research AG (CTR, Austria), a research center for 
intelligent sensors. 
In 2015, I 
have been appointed as a [Junior Fellow](https://gi.de/ueber-uns/personen/junior-fellows) of the GI. 

My [research](/research/) focuses on the engineering of complex, long-lasting, software-intensive systems within various 
application domains in an integrated approach with different disciplines. 
I have experience in software language engineering, the engineering of digital twins, 
and the model-driven software engineering of information and assistive systems. 
Find more details in my recent [publications](/publications/).
