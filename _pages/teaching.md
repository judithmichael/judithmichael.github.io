For me, research and teaching are closely linked. 
Teaching becomes more exciting when you can bring examples from practice and current research results, 
and in research, we benefit from the new ideas that students contribute.  
Thus, I try to foster the interest of students
in research topics such as modeling, generative methods, system architectures or assistive systems
and involve them in research in an early stage in seminars, lectures, projects and theses.

## Lectures

#### Softwaretechnik
- [Winter 20/21](https://www.se-rwth.de/teaching/ws2021/swt/)
- [Winter 19/20](https://www.se-rwth.de/teaching/ws1920/swt/)

#### Digitalization
- [Summer 19](http://www.se-rwth.de/teaching/ss19/digitalisation/)

#### Assistive Systems

- Current Topics in Application Engineering: Ambient Assistance (Master Computer Science)
- Current Topics in Application Engineering: Ambient Assisted Living (Master Computer Science)

#### Business Information Systems
Topics of this lecture in the Master Computer Science included e.g., behavior modeling with BPMN, 
workflow systems, architectures,
domain specific languages and language engineering (2014, 2017). 

#### Ringvorlesung: Frauen - Männer - Wirtschaft
Within the lecture series women - man - business, I held one lecture about gender specifics in the engineering 
and use of IT systems.
