For me, research and teaching are closely linked. 
Teaching becomes more exciting when you can bring examples from practice and current research results, 
and in research, we benefit from the new ideas that students contribute. Thus, I try to foster the interest of students
in research topics such as modeling, generative methods, system architectures or assistive systems
and involve them in research in an early stage in seminars, lectures, projects and theses.

## Lectures

#### Software Engineering 
This lecture introduces the foundations for the engineering of complex software systems. 
Covered topics are development process models, requirements elicitation, software architecture and design as 
well as the implementation, generation and quality assurance with tests. 
The lecture uses primarily the modeling language UML.

- [Winter 20/21](https://www.se-rwth.de/teaching/ws2021/swt/)
- [Winter 19/20](https://www.se-rwth.de/teaching/ws1920/swt/)

#### Digitalization
The lecture "Digitalization" explores and discusses digitalisation from different perspectives of informatics: 
We investigate fundamentals of the terms digitalization, digitization and digital transformation, 
its classification in the discipline informatics, relation to IT-systems and software engineering methods as 
well as strategies for digitalization. Discussions stimulate a critical examination of the terms. 
Furthermore, lecturers from industry discuss current developments that are advancing the digitalization 
of their economic sector and provide practical examples. This includes domains such as automotive, automation, health, 
production or public Infrastructure.

#### Assistive Systems
Ambient Assistance denotes the ICT based contact free, autonomous and unobtrusive support of persons in a given life 
situation or for mastering a particular task. Ambient Assistance Systems have to provide means for (a) recognizing a 
given situation, (b) determining the resulting need of actions, and (c) inducing appropriately targeted measures or 
rendering support information in a form adapted to the situation.
The lecture for the Master Computer Science introduces into the methods and techniques that have been developed 
for these purposes, sketches the 
current state-of-the-art, and increases the understanding of the participants by project work.

- Current Topics in Application Engineering: Ambient Assisted Living

#### Current Topics in Business Information Systems
In contrast to general purpose languages, domain-specific languages (DSLs) can be tailored for specific needs. 
Topics of this lecture and project class (2014, 2017) in the Master Computer Science include, 
e.g., how to engineer such languages, 
behavior modeling with BPMN, workflow systems and system architectures which are able to handle DSLs . 
Moreover, we have shown example languages from the ambient assistance domain and students created their own DSLs.

#### Ringvorlesung: Frauen - Männer - Wirtschaft
The interdisciplinary lecture series (2012/13) deals with gender role-typical behavior and the relationships between and within 
the genders in business. The aim was to raise awareness for gender-specific differences on the one hand, but also for 
existing unobjective differentiation between the genders. 
The focus was not only on women, but also on men with their changed role requirements. 
Within this lecture series women - man - economy, my focus was on gender specifics in the engineering 
and use of IT systems.

## Other

Moreover, I've been teaching in the [NEMO Summer School](http://nemo.omilab.org/) 
(Next-Generation Enterprise Modelling, 2014-2020) and in 
University Level Courses 
([ULG IT Business Solutions](https://www.aau.at/universitaetslehrgaenge/it-business-solutions/)) 
for the M/O/T (Alpen-Adria-School of Management, Organizational Development and Technology).

In a student project, we have developed a tool for the visualization of different serach, and sort algoritms as well as binary trees and
B-trees for other students, who want to understand the algorithms more easily. It was
further improved within the last years with other student projects and is still available:
[go2algo](https://www.syssec.at/de/lehre/go2algo).
