Conferences and workshops are an important vehicle for science to promote professional discourse and critical discussions. 
We are happy to contribute to the organization of these events. To mention some:

- PC Co-Chair of [ECMFA 2024](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/program?id=813&f=European) and [Modellierung 2024](https://bpt.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/modellierung2024/)
- Workshop co-chair of [SE 2022](https://www.se-2022.de/) and [Modellierung 2022](https://qfam.gi.de/modellierung2022)
- Organizer of the Workshop on Modeling in (and for) Production 
[MoPro'2022](https://judithmichael.github.io/mopro22)
- Co-chair of [EMISA 2020](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2628/) 
and [2021](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2867/)
- [ER 2022](https://er2022web.github.io/ER2022/) publicity and social media co-chair and co-chair of the [ER 2020 Forum](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2716/). 
- Local organiation of the [Informatik 2016](http://www.informatik2016.de/),

[Modellierung 2010](http://dblp1.uni-trier.de/db/conf/modellierung/index).

Besides this, I am and have been serving in program committees of various conferences and workshops, e.g.,
the *[Int. Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems, MODELS](https://dl.acm.org/conference/models)* Practice and Innovation Track,

the *[Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (Euromicro SEAA)](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/program?id=2600&s=SEAA&f=Software%20Engineering%20and%20Advanced%20Applications)* Model-Driven Engineering and Modeling Languages (MDEML) Track (2023),
the *INFORMATIK* conference series of the German Informatics Society (GI), e.g., 
the WS [Informatik-Begeisterung 2016](https://dl.gi.de/handle/20.500.12116/993) and the 
co-located [Studierendenkonferenz Informatik, SKILL](http://skill.gi.de/), 
and the *[Modellierung](https://qfam.gi.de/)* series of the German Informatics Society (GI), e.g., 
*[Workshops, Tools and Demos](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2542/)*.

Moreover, I have reviewed for the following journals:

Regarding academic self-administration at the Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt I was, e.g., a member of the Senate, 
of the Committee of Continuing Education, of the Curricular Commissions Doctorate, 
Informatics and Information Technology, the Think Tank Young Academic Talent of the 
Vice-Rectorship for Research as well as ERASMUS Coordinator for the Exchange between AAU and the 
Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT), Germany.
