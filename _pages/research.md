My research focus are (conceptual) models in a variety of domains and applications. 
We develop domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) and methods (DSMMs) for 
domains such as Ambient Assisted Living, Controlling and Finances, Energy, Health, 
Internet of Production (IoP), Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0 or Smart Homes. 
The models created with such languages can be used to develop model-based assistance 
and information systems and services. In focus of such languages is either structural 
and/or behavioral data (see context modeling 
[[MS17]](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1979/paper-22.pdf)), 
the system architecture or a combination of both 
[[ANV+18]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Model-Based-Generation-of-Enterprise-Information-Systems.pdf). 
Recent work deals with digital twins [[DMR+20]](http://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Towards-a-Model-Driven-Architecture-for-Interactive-Digital-Twin-Cockpits.pdf), 
the human factor in the internet of production [[MNRV19]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Towards-Privacy-Preserving-IoT-Systems-Using-Model-Driven-Engineering.pdf), 
user-centered data privacy [[MKM+19]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/User-Centered-and-Privacy-Driven-Process-Mining-System-Design-for-IoT.pdf), 
smart assisted living [[SM20]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Using-Semantic-Markup-to-Boost-Context-Awareness-for-Assistive-Systems.pdf), 
the semantic analysis of models [[DKMR19](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Semantic-Evolution-Analysis-of-Feature-Models.pdf),[DKMR20](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Pre-Study-on-the-Usefulness-of-Difference-Operators-for-Modeling-Languages-in-Software-Development.pdf)], 
behavior goal modeling [[MRV20]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Human-Behavior-Goals-and-Model-Driven-Software-Engineering-for-Assistive-Systems.pdf) 
and assistive and informative systems in general.
This website presents selected research topics and related publications.
The full list of publications is available from my [publications](../publications) website.

### Assistive Systems


### Digital Twins & Digital Shadows
In our understanding, a digital twin consists of a set of models of the system, 
a set of digital shadows, and provides a set of services to use the data and models 
purposefully with respects to the original system.
