My research focus are (conceptual) models in a variety of domains and applications. We develop domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) and methods (DSMMs) for domains such as Ambient Assisted Living, Controlling and Finances, Energy, Health, Internet of Production (IoP), Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0 or Smart Homes. The models created with such languages can be used to develop model-based assistance and information systems and services. In focus of such languages is either structural and/or behavioral data (see context modeling [[MS17]](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1979/paper-22.pdf)), the system architecture or a combination of both [[ANV+18]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Model-Based-Generation-of-Enterprise-Information-Systems.pdf). Recent work deals with digital twins [[DMR+20]](http://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Towards-a-Model-Driven-Architecture-for-Interactive-Digital-Twin-Cockpits.pdf), the human factor in the internet of production [[MNRV19]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Towards-Privacy-Preserving-IoT-Systems-Using-Model-Driven-Engineering.pdf), user-centered data privacy [[MKM+19]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/User-Centered-and-Privacy-Driven-Process-Mining-System-Design-for-IoT.pdf), smart assisted living [[SM20]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Using-Semantic-Markup-to-Boost-Context-Awareness-for-Assistive-Systems.pdf), the semantic analysis of models [[DKMR19](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Semantic-Evolution-Analysis-of-Feature-Models.pdf),[DKMR20](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Pre-Study-on-the-Usefulness-of-Difference-Operators-for-Modeling-Languages-in-Software-Development.pdf)], behavior goal modeling [[MRV20]](https://www.se-rwth.de/publications/Human-Behavior-Goals-and-Model-Driven-Software-Engineering-for-Assistive-Systems.pdf) and assistive and informative systems in general.

### Assistive Systems
### Digital Twins & Digital Shadows
In our understanding, a digital twin consists of a set of models of the system, a set of digital shadows, and provides a set of services to use the data and models purposefully with respects to the original system.
