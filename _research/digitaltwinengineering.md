In our understanding, a digital twin consists of a set of models of the system,
a set of digital shadows [BBD+21], and provides a set of services to use the data and models
purposefully with respects to the original system 
(original definition:[DMR+20], Version 2.0 in [HHMR23]).

For DT engineering, software and systems models can be used to support
the design process, construction, operation, and end-of-life of related physical objects. Our main use
cases are from the production domain, as I am leading the workstream “Foundations of Digital
Shadows” within the [Cluster of Excellence “Internet of Production”](/projects/iop/). We are
working on the conceptualization of digital shadows, DT architectures, how to perform process
prediction with DTs and integrate process mining techniques in MDSE, low-code development
platforms for DTs, and the generation of DT cockpits and process-aware DT cockpits from event logs.
We have investigated integration challenges for DT systems-of-systems and SE challenges in cyber-physical
production systems engineering with industry. We work on privacy-preserving system design
of IoT systems, and model-driven IoT app stores.
